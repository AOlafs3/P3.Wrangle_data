Area Chosen:
Kenosha, Wisconsin
https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=12/42.5885/-87.9016

Kenosha is located just north of the border with Illinois nestled close to the shore of Lake Michigan.

I chose this area due to the fact that I am currently on a military deployment with members of the unit mainly being from the
Wisconsin area. I am from the Seattle area myself so felt it would be interesting to look further into this area.
